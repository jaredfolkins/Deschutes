Description:

This is a web scraping program I wrote to mine the
deschutes county website public foreclosure records.
I use this data to determine how many foreclosures
are coming to market and understand better buying
opportunities.

Examples:

$ruby worker_bot.rb -h

Usage: worker_bot.rb
Deschutes County Records WebCrawler Options:

        --page=PAGE                  Crawl a specific page's tree. PAGE takes precedence over SKIP. Also, error will occur if YEAR is set.

        --year=YEAR                  Crawl through documents based by year.
        --trace=TRACE                Enable Memprof to profile code.
